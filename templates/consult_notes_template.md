## Documents

I explained the importance of submitting supporting documentation to the IPO, especially ID documents and that they must by genuine. 
The client has some documents, inclduing a newspaper clipping, that she brought from {nationality}. These are on her phone. She said she would provide them to the LAB to be included in her file. 
I urged her to do so as there is an expectation that effort is made in this regard.  
I explained that if no pertinent and relevant documents are produced, they may be asked to explain why and the efforts made to obtain same to the IPO.


## Travel to Ireland 

I asked client for full travel details from {nationality} to Ireland including countries passed through, mode of transport, if accompanied by an smuggler etc.

{travel}

## EURODAC / Visa Information

The client confirmed that she had not applied for international protection elsewhere.

## Admissibility issues

As the client had not applied for asylum at the first oportunity after entering the State, I explained that there may be admissibility issues raised by the IPO/Dept. of Justice. She provided an explanation for not applying for asylum at the first opportunity on the basis that she had entered the State on foot of a work visa and had been offered a job in Waterford hospital, contingent on her passing her nursing exams. She failed the exams at first take, but passed them on teh second take, in October 2022. She then explained that she had applied for a special skills visa but that this had been rejected on the basis that her previous work permit/visa had expired. 

## Client's account of persecution

{basis}

## Serious harm on Return to CoI

Does the client fear the death penalty or execution and/or inhumane or degrading treatment or torture or punishment and/or indiscriminate violence as a result of armed internal or international conflict?

No

## Internal relocation
As persecution emanates from state agent, internal relocation may not be pertinent. However, continued presence of her husband and five children at their home may raise some credibility issues around this. 

## State protection

Not applicable.

## Permission to remain

I explained to the client that as the claim progresses, efforts should be made to integrate and connect within the State and local community. I explained the importance of supporting documentation regarding employment and/or education and/or volunteering and gathering character references and to keep us updated in this regard.  I explained the importance of informing us of engaging with outreach services.

## Access to labour market

Client was asked if she had applied for her labour market access and if she had secured employment. It was explained that she could apply afer 5 months for same.

## Explained to the client obligations and responsibilities:

- Not to leave the State without Minister’s consent
- Importance of co-operation with all organisations including LAB and IPO
- To give detailed, accurate, consistent and genuine information and documents and that not doing so can lead to credibility
 - That access to the labour market can be sought after 6 months
 - To inform LAB and IPO of a change of address or contact number

## Medical Issues

N/A

## Section 35 interview

I explained to the client they must attend the interview and that absence is accepted on medical grounds only and that in that case, we have only 3 days to submit the medical certificate or give a reasonable excuse.  I explained that their solicitor will arrange a pre-interview consultation to prepare them for the s. 35 interview and explain the appeals process in the event of a negative decision.  The client had no particular requests relating to this interview.

## Notes to the solicitor

- Are the issues above relevant to the making of a claim for IP?

I feel that on the information provided by the client at this consultation, a claim for international protection is at least statable, and pointed out the weaknesses in the case as presented to me.

On balance, a claim for asylum is at least stateable on the following grounds:

> {reasons}

On the basis of the narrative provided by the client I would suggest possible draft grounds as follows:


- Was the IP application made ASAP?

No. The client had entered the State a year prior to making the claim. However, a reason was given, *viz.* that she had entered the State on foot of a work permit visa which had since expired for various reasons, including that she had failed her nursing exams. 

- If client can relocate safely within their CoO, inform them that significant weight may be given to this by the IPO.

- Is the client from a safe country of origin?

Yes. 

- Is the client classed as a vulnerable person?

No.

- Are there any matters that require the solicitor's immediate attention, *e.g.* domestic violence/suicidal client/client unfit for interview, *etc.*?

Client states she is suffering from depression and was tearful at points during interview, particularly when talking about family. Advised to consult with psychiatrist and obtain a report thereon and provide it to LAB asap so that same could be placed on file if necessary for submissions, *etc.*. 

## Human trafficking indicators?

N/A.
